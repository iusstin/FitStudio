# FitStudio
Gym Web App created with ReactJS and Python Flask
For the moment, I created 2 web pages:
- the first one contains a form with which users can book a class (save their data into a txt file, after completing the form);
- in the second one, I request the data (bookings) from the txt file and put them in a table
